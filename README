This extension for Visual Studio 2010 allows you to diff the currently
selected text against the contents of the clipboard, which is useful
for example if you have two methods that are a copy of each other with
just slight differences and you want to merge them into one. Which diff 
tool you use is configurable, any diff tool that takes two file names as
parameters will do (i.e. all of them).
